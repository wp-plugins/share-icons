== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why did you develop this plugin? =

I thought it would be nice to add share buttons to my own blog and did not like the other share button WP plugins so I ended up making my own then decided I would share it for free.

The best way to contact me is through my website: Jusarg.com
